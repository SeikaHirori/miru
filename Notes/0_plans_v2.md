# Background
- v2 of the app to write the code from scratch.
- v1 is messy AND rewriting everything would take a while.
    - It did provide a nice testing ground to learn though.

# Objectives
- Write cleaner code with new knowledge.
    - TDD the heck out of the process.
        - Create function tests first, then unit tests.
