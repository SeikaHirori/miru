> Kitsu's XML uses myanimelist.com (MAL)'s database (DB) as the foundation to store information. From the look of it, Kitsu uses MAL's DB has it's own separate database to store their own link/webpage.
    - (UPDATE 8-5-2022) Anilist also uses MAL's id as the foundation. Need to clean up module "info_user_media.py" with this new info.

> Will eventually learn how to scrap data from websites themselves. Will start off on Manga first as no database exists.

# Anime Databases
- Offline anime DB:
    - Has crossreference info 
> https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database


# Manga database
- Offline DB doesn't exist, so learning how to scrape data eventually

# Light novel database
MAL, Kitsu, and Anilist lists light novels under "manga" for the url and POTENTIALLY category type. 

- Examples for light novel, 86:
    - https://myanimelist.net/manga/104039/86
    - https://kitsu.io/manga/eighty-six
        - doesn't publicly list id
    - https://anilist.co/manga/98610/86-Eighty-Six
