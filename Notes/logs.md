- NExt time:
    - Learn how to validate json
        - Read this:
            > https://stackoverflow.com/a/54491882

- Ending sesh:
    - Finished implementating and writing test for function:
        - read_json()
            - There might be scenarios I am unaccounting for.
            - I think it might be to verify the repo before saving locally.


- Resuming session:
    - ~~Working on download_json() first~~ #Complete
        - Need to add script:
            ~~ > If folder doesn't exist, create the directory to contain the database. ~~ #Completed

- Next time:
    - Read how to work with JSON
        - Resources to read on topic:
            > https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON
            > https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2018/notes/4
            > https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/notes/5/
        - Potentially examples on how Json is used?:
            > ~~ https://github.com/lagmoellertim/pyon ~~ This is library, so nope.

- Uninstalled pytest-monitor as it doesn't work on Apple Silicon

- Implemented finding pathway of anime database json file.
