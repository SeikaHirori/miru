# Objective:
- Resolve personal issue of "o no, what anime/manga should I from my ***MAL/Anilist/Kitsu.io*** list? idk sad :'("
- LEARN WHAT AND HOW EVERYTHING WORKS :3
# First phase of project
- Learn how to parse and obtain values from user's MAL/Anilist/Kitsu.io list...
- As well as obtain certain values from the anime database JSON
    - Thanks to Minami Project for hosting and updating the anime database!
        - Link: https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database/blob/master/anime-offline-database.json
- From the user's list, obtain a random anime title.
- Due to how anime title's ID (id primarily belongs to MAL) are stored on each of the sites...
    - If user primarily site is either Anilist or Kitsu.io:
        - Obtain value from "sources" in anime database for respective site.

# Future phases
I won't talk future plans about it publically as things are always bound to change. I am learning about so much of these cool tools, so it's constantly evolving. The next phase should be interesting though :3
